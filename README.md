Rakkas is a dual script font that currently supports Arabic and Latin. The Arabic was designed drawing inspiration from Ruq'ah lettering found on Egyptian movie posters from the 50s and 60s. The Latin was designed to compliment the Arabic, fusing a blackletter foundation with a informal sensibility.

The next steps for Rakkas is to widen its language support; for Latin up to Latin 5, for Arabic, Urdu and Persian.

You can catch up with the early stages of Rakkas' design on [the project site](theruqahproject.com).The blog will pick up updates once the initial release is complete.

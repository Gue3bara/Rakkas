Rakkas is single-weight dual-script display typeface developed for the Google Webfont library. It comprises an Arabic, inspired by Ruq'ah lettering on Egyptian movie posters of the 50s and 60s, and a Latin that merges blackletter strokes with informality. Rakkas' Arabic makes use of contextual alternates to emulate Ruq'ah lettering. 
It features several different forms for many of its letter's positions (there are three different initial behs, the use of which depend on the proceeding letter), in order to ensure the greatest amount of fidelity to traditional Ruq'ah's whimsy and fluidity. It also cascades vertically, giving the user an opportunity to play with wordspacing. One of the things the Latin and Arabic have in common is the stroke that shape the letters. For Arabic, it's standard for the horizontal stroke to be the thickest. For Latin, developed later, it was about being complimentary, yet still contextually relevant. This lent itself to a thick horizontal instroke, as in the lowercase 'a', and to the occasional entire reversal of contrast, as in the lowercase 'z'. For Arabic, the dot marks are significicantly smaller than what one might expect; they don't share the thickness of the stroke. This was another quirk adopted from many of the lettering samples used as reference. Latin follows suit: Not only are the diacritics quite a bit smaller, but also many of the punctuation marks, symbols, etc, make use of the thin monolinear stroke, instead of the more common use of stem width. The result is two scripts united under a stylistic umbrella but neither pretending to be the other, and each interesting in its own right.

The next steps for Rakkas is to widen its language support; for Latin up to Latin 5, for Arabic, Urdu and Persian.

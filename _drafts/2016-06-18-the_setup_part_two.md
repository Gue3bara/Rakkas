<p class="intro">
Ruq'ah, like many Arabic calligraphic styles, and unlike any of Latin, cascades. When starting a typographic adaption, the cascade angle is one of the most important considerations.

As the reader may have guessed, I've used [Glyphs](https://glyphsapp.com) as the font editor for this project. I've found it handles Arabic well, with built-in encoding sets for beginners to boot. The connectivity, as far as software is concerned, will be handled using OpenType cursive attachment. Rainer Erich Scheichelbauer has a great [tutorial](https://glyphsapp.com/tutorials/arabic) on setting up the entry and exit anchors to achieve basic connectivity in  Arabic.

So this post doesn't deal with the software mechanics, rather, it  deals with the physical and aesthetic elements of connectivity. The established way of connecting letters in Arabic type design is by overlapping the in- and out-strokes. Most contemporary typefaces I know, especially high-contrast Naskh ones, do this by having rounded, semi-elliptical terminals at the end of either stroke in order to achieve a smooth, corner-free connection.

*A prominent Arabic typeface, Nassim, makes use of the rounded overlap connection*

This works because the horizontal stroke is parallel to the baseline;  
When I began designing the first connecting letters, I initially tried to apply this method. But soon it became apparent that the cascade angle and the cornered design features didn't mesh well; the rounded terminals . The second

*The medial beh form sits on a six-degree incline.*

This will be the slope my letters climb down as the word ends and reaches the baseline. For connecting letters, like the medial beh above, and letters with a strong horizontal stroke, the angle is applied faithfully. For round letters, like the isolated beh below, the angle is implied but of course not visible.

*The isolated beh form fits the incline but doesn't adhere to it due to its round bowl.*

In the second part of the "Setup" series, I will talk in-depth about what the angles mean for how the letters connect.
